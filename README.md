# Mobile Friendly Web Design - day 7 - parallax-practice  

### Description
This is was started during mobile friendly website class day 7.  I used my bootstrap boiler plate as the template.

[Example page](https://geekwiseacademy.github.io/virtual-mobile-friendly-websites/img/parallax-practice.jpg)

- Add any 2 fonts from Google Fonts (Note: the example uses "Lobster" and "Open Sans")
- Add a navbar and a jumbotron with text
- Add Font Awesome to your project (You will need this for your footer)
- Add a parallax effect to all of your page sections
- Make sure your navbar links to all your sections

### To get Started
`git clone` repository

**Using Aramayis Orkusyan recompiled Bootstrap with a flag set that enables responsive font sizes (ver BootStrab 4.5.2)**
